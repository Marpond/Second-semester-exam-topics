## Logical architecture
The logical architecture is the large scale organization of software classes into packages, subsystems and layers. It's called the logical architecture because there's no decision about how these elements are deployed across different OS processes or physical computers in a network.

## Layers
Grouping of classes, packages or subsystems that has cohesive responsibility for a major aspect of the system. They are organized such that **higher** layers call upon services of **lower** layers and normally vice versa.

## Java packages
A grouping of classes, interfaces, enums, records, etc.
It provides access protection and namespace management, prevents naming conflicts, also the code is tidier.

## Domain model
A domain model is a visual representation of conceptual classes or real-situation objects in a domain. It is one of the artifacts that may be created in the Business Modeling discipline. It is illustrated with a set of class diagrams in which no operations are defined.

## Techniques to create a domain model
1. Find the conceptual classes
2. Draw them as classes in a UML class diagram
3. Add associations and attributes.

## The mapmaker strategy
1. Use existing names for things, the vocabulary of the domain.
2. Exclude irrelevant features.
3. Do not add things that are not there.

## Description classes
A description class contains data that describes something else.

A description class is useful when:
1. There needs to be a description about something completely independent of the current existence of any instance of that something.
2. Deleting something would result in the loss of description of that thing, even though that information needs to be maintained.
3. It reduces redundancy or duplicated data.

## Multiplicities
A multiplicity defines how many instances of class A can be associated with one instance of class B.

## Attribute or class

## Purpose of domain model
It's a way to describe and model real world entities and the relationships between them.

## UML class diagrams
Used to illustrate classes, interfaces, and their associations in object oriented systems. Used for static object modeling.

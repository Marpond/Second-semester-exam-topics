**Sprint planning meeting**
- **First 4 hours**
Product owner prioritizes the items, on the product backlog they raise the team's understanding of the items, in dialogue with the team the best possible set of items are selected, then a sprint backlog is selected.
- **Last 4 hours**
The scrum team works on the sprint backlog in further detail, items are broken down into tasks (no more than 16 hrs per task), they count the resources and the hours available, then they make an initial assignment who does which task, then they make the sprint backlog public.

**Performing a sprint**
The team self-organizes, splits the work. The team attends the daily scrum meetings and update estimates on the sprint backlog. They are set free to fulfill the sprint.

**Daily scrum meetings**
Lasts 15 minutes, same place same time every working day. The meeting is public, but only the scrum team and master speaks. Three questions are asked to each team member: What have you done, what will you do, anything holding you back? Then the scrum master reports on their work, such as removed obstacles and implemented improvements.

**Sprint review meeting**
Lasts max 4 hours (max 2 hrs for preparation), the team presents the finished functionalities, stakeholders ask questions and make comments. Product owner and stakeholders list the things missing, things they want to change or new things they want to prioritize, all of this goes to the product backlog.

**Sprint retrospective meeting**
The scrum team and master reviews the sprint. They go over what went well and what could be improved. After the discussion and prioritization the items for improvement go on the product backlog as non-functional items.

## Work products
**Product backlog**
A product backlog is a list of customer-centric features, also called items. It's the product road map, it is the single, definitive view of "everything that could be done by the team ever, in order of priority".

**Sprint backlog**
A sprint backlog only includes what needs to be done during the specific sprint. It covers the most current activities, so it typically contains more details and more complete user stories than the rest of the product backlog.

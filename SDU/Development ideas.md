## Waterfall
A project management methodology based on a sequential design process.

**Phases**
1. **Requirements**
	- Starts with the concept, or the idea the customer wants
2. **Design**
	- Includes the logical and physical design
3. **Implementation**
	- Building the design to software
4. **Verification**
	- Testing the software against the requirements
5. **Deployment**
	- Actual release of the software
6. **Maintenance**
	- The phase of the project in which initial issues are resolved

**Advantages**
- Easy to understand and manage
**Disadvantages**
- Not flexible
- Not suitable for complex long-term projects

## Waterfall vs iterative
Waterfall is a sequential design process. There is only one phase of designing,  implementing, testing, etc. In contrast, in an iterative process, the development is segmented into different iterations, each with their own design, implementation, integrate, testing, etc. In iterative development the software grows incrementally after every iteration, and unlike in waterfall the user feedback plays a huge role throughout the whole process even in the very early stages. Iterations are not prototypes, but rather production-grade subsets of the final system.

## Timeboxing
The key idea is that iterations are timeboxed, or in other words fixed in length. Normally an iteration should take between 2 to 6 weeks. Anything below the minimum would result in an unfinished iteration, or anything above the maximum would make the iteration too complex and the feedback would be delayed. For very large teams however, there were cases where each iteration lasted 6 months. If some requirements were not finished in said iteration, it should be pushed to the next one instead of delaying the release.

## UP phases and disciplines
**Phases
1. **Inception
	- It is a kind of feasibility phase, where just enough investigation is done to support a decision to continue or stop.
2. **Elaboration
	- It is a phase where the core architecture is iteratively implemented, and high risk issues are mitigated.
3. **Construction
	- Iterative implementation of the remaining lower risk and easier elements, and preparation for deployment.
4. **Transition
	- Beta tests, deployment

**Disciplines**
Disciplines are a set of activities, for example:
- **Business Modeling
	- 
- **Requirements
	- Requirement analysis for an application, such as writing use cases and identifying non-functional requirements
- **Design
	- All aspects of design, such as databases, networking, and alike.

## UP artifacts and timing
**Artifact**
An artifact is the general term for any work product: code, database schema, diagrams, modules, models, etc. They are considered optional, and should be dropped if their worth is not proved. The point of an artifact is not the document or diagram itself, but the thinking, analysis and proactive readiness.

**Timing**
I would guess it's timeboxing.

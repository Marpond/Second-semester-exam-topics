The relational model is an approach to managing data. All data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations.

## **E/R Model**

#### Entity
An irl thing (physical or conceptual existence).

##### Attributes
Properties that describe the entities.
Types:
1.  Simple (Can't be further divided: Weight)
2.  Composite (Can be divided: Name)
3.  Single-value (Age)
4.  Multi-valued (Languages known)
5.  Derived (Can be derived from other attributes: Age (from DoB))
6.  Stored (Date of birth)

##### Attribute domain
Set of values allowed in an attribute.

##### Relationship

## **Database table/relation**
Tables are the basic building blocks of a relational database. Entity sets, aka a group of related entities are stored in tables.

## Round robin
Preemptive version of first-come first-served, each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way.

## First come, first served
Used by OS-es and networks, automatically executes queued tasks, processes and requests based on the order of their arrival.

## Shortest job first
The process with the smallest execution time comes next.

## Priority scheduling
As the name suggests, the scheduling is based on priority. Processes with the same priorities are executed in either a round robin or first come, first served fashion.

## Windows scheduler
The highest priority runnable thread always runs.

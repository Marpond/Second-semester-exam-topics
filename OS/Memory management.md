## Buddy system
Memory allocation and management algorithm that manages memory in power of two increments.

## Virtual memory
With virtual memory the computer can compensate for physical memory shortages. Using of both hardware and software, the computer temporarily transfers data from RAM to a disk storage.

## Memory management unit
The MMU is a hardware component that handles all memory and caching operations associated with the CPU. It's usually part of the Central Unit, in some systems it occupies a separate integrated circuit chip.

**Responsibilities of the MMU**
1. Hardware memory management, oversees and regulates the CPU's RAM usage and cache memory.
2. OS memory management, ensures that there's enough memory resource for each running program's objects and data resources.
3. App memory management, allocates each individual program's required memory, recycles freed-up memory space when the operation concludes.

## Paging
The primary method of implementing virtual storage.

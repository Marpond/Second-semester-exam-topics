## Arrays
**Array references**
In this case, scores does not hold any value itself but it's a reference to the array to the right. That array is stored elsewhere.
```java
int[] scores = { 10, 9, 7, 4, 5 };
```

**Partially filled arrays**
In a typical program run, only a part of the array will be occupied by actual elements.

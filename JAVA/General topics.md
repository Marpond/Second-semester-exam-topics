## Computers overview
The computer is a machine that stores data, interacts with devices and executes programs. A computer program tells a computer in minute detail, the sequence of steps that are needed to fulfill a task.

**Anatomy**
At the heart of a PC, there's the CPU, that performs **program control** and **data processing**:
- Locates and executes program instructions, carries out arithmetic operations.
- Fetches data from external memory or devices and places processed data into storage.

There are two kinds of storage, **primary storage** or **memory**, is made from electronic circuits that can store data. Secondary storage, such as a HDD, SSD or an M.2 provides less expensive storage that persists without electricity.

## Algorithms
**Unambiguous**
There are precise instructions for each step to be taken and what to do next.
**Executable**
It can be carried out in practice.
**Terminating**
If a sequence of steps will eventually come to an end.

**Algorithm**
A sequence of steps the is unambiguous, executable and terminating.

## Flowcharts
Used to visualize the steps to be taken when solving a problem.

## Test cases
When writing test cases, we want to ensure everything works properly. Working through test cases gives us a better understanding of the algorithm we are about to implement. It's helpful to have a flowchart when writing test cases.

## Comments
Explanation of code for human readers, it is ignored by the compiler.
A commonly used tool to make reading and understanding code a lot easier.
